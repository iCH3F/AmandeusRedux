# AmandusRedux

AmandusRedux is an updated and expanded upon version of <a href="https://github.com/Muirey03/Amandus">Amandus</a> by <a href="https://twitter.com/Muirey03">Muirey03</a>.

I have forked it to update and maintain it for iOS 13+

This tweak is designed to be minimalistic and streamlined so that it really feels like Apple Pay belongs as a part of iOS
